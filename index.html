<h1><strong>On my way</strong></h1><br>
<p>This is a personal blog to document my journey to become a software developer.</p><hr>
<h3><em>Beginning</em></h3>
<p>
	I have always been into STEM education majoring in automotive engineering, fixing computers on the side and having software developers among friends. I have not had a chance to seriously dive into coding, not until moocs and other online learning tools took the stage and made it all possible for me. Being a lifelong learner and obtaining a 24/7 self paced online access to education meant I could do it despite having a full time job and two little baby girls at home. So I jumped right into it.
