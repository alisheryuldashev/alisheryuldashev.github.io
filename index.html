<h1><strong>On my way to...</strong></h1><br>
<p>This is a personal blog to document my journey towards becoming a software developer and finding work that I will be proud to tell everyone about. If you like to follow along, I'd be excited to share with you what I learn.</p><hr class="style1">

<h3>Beginning</h3>
<p><span class="text-muted">
	I have always been into STEM, majoring in automotive engineering, configuring and fixing computers as a side hustle business, and having software developers among friends. Moreover, I worked in IT companies from startup to big firms, but always thought that my average math skills wouldn't be enough to learn how to code. So I have not had a chance to seriously dive into coding (high tuition costs, lack of time, playing in a rock band and moving to different countries for work), not until MOOCS and other online learning tools took the stage and made it all possible for me. I had a gainful employment and a family with two sweet baby girls at that time. So the only thing I was missing was to spend my working hours on something meaningful to me, on something I was quite interested in - solving problems on a computer. Being a lifelong learner and getting a 24/7 self paced online access to programming courses meant I could do it in my spare time. So I jumped right into it.
</span></p><hr>

<h3>First encounter</h3>
<p><span class="text-muted">
	The earliest opportunity presented itself in August 2015 when my family went on a month long vacation and I was left with too much time on my hands. My regular routine was to wake up at 5 a.m. and go to the gym. Then be at work from 9 to 5, and come back home at around 6 p.m. Because I was never a big fan of wasting my time by watching tv shows (except for a few ones) or playing video games on my xbox I started exploring different online resources and educate myself with programming languages which I would later find out form the front end development (aka client-side development) - html/css/javascript. I was already using html to do some minor updates to a corporate intranet at work, but I never realized how fun html and css were. Building the "Like" buttons and "Comments" text fields in html for my online projects just blew my mind and I felt so empowered. Who knows, maybe sometime soon I will be forever grateful to my family for giving me this month "off" to pursue my interest. Maybe that one right direction and one positive action can take me to the whole new level of my life. Only time will tell. 
</span></p><hr>

<h3>Meetups</h3>
<p><span class="text-muted">
  After my family came back from vacation I had to reconsider my routine. You know you are a parent when you cram your entire adult life between the time your kids go down and you go to sleep, right? 
  I was able to quickly learn basics of markup language and cascading styles, but quickly got stuck at javascript and at developing my first portfolio site. Having things around didn't help much so I had to ditch my gym routine and do coding instead. Unfortunately, online courses couldn't get me far because I needed more help and guidance. So I turned my attention to local meetup groups and started attending a few meetings for aspiring developers. It was a great experience because not only I met people who just like me wanted to break into this field, but also a few real world developers who shared a lot of new knowledge and concepts with me. We had sessions where we would create our own domain and upload our mock websites. Or do some bootstrap magic along with ruby sites and learn mobile development. My head was spinning from all that knowledge, but it was at that time when I started to see that it was all possible for me and that i don't need to worry about something like "I could never be a developer".

<h3>My nightmare</h3>
<p><span class="text-muted">
  Soon I doubled down on my online studying the results of which were creating a simple discussion board site in PHP with login autorization and a basic Android mobile app (i wasn't a big fan of iPhones at that time) that would act like a flashlight. I even started googling local tech companies and imagining how cool it would be to work for some of them. I picked my top 3 and even connected to some HR people from those companies on LinkedIn. And just when I pondered of approaching them on LinkedIn to take my first step I had this terrible nightmare happened to me. This is what I remembered when I woke up... I was sitting in this nice reception area, you know those ones that most corporate firms have, with receptionists, flowers and glass doors. It turned out I was there for an interview waiting for my turn. I looked around and I saw the HR lady from my top 3 tech firm list(!) interviewing somebody behind the glass door. I looked the other way and saw another candidate approaching me and then we start talking about how nervous we are at interviews. Suddenly this person asks me if I know how to solve the fizz buzz problem and when I said no he laughed out loud. He said how can you pass any interviews if you don't know how to solve a fizz buzz problem. I felt so embarassed because everyon in reception including HR person who came out to grab the next candidate could hear our conversation. Ashamed of myself, I got up and left. And that's when I woke up.

<h3>Diving in</h3>
<p><span class="text-muted">
  This nightmare was a great wake up call because that's when I realized I needed a more fundamental knowledge to fill in the gaps in my skill set. Yes, I could put simple websites together by then, but as soon as I tried something harder like bootstraping elements or adding paralax scrolling efects, my end products would look like some slow loading frankensteins. Here is a screenshot of my very first "frankenstein" portfolio web site. <br/> <img class="img-responsive" class="img-thumbnail" class="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14170402/37854066-f7b5dac4-2eae-11e8-9b3d-abbf03cdd532.PNG" width="304" height="236"> <br/> I knew I could no longer just copy and paste code snippets and call myself a developer. I needed to find a more comprehensive course that would not only give me a better understanding of programming, but would also show my potential employers that I was not their average junior developer. Going back to university for another 4 years of engineering degree was not an option due to my demanding work and family duties. Moving forward to 2016, after countless nights scouring the internet and reading about each course and what it offered, I finally found what I was looking for. It was a very intense but highly regarded online certificate course on introduction to computer science offered by one of the top universities in the world. It taught how to think algorithmically and its topics included abstraction, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. After watching their first lecture I knew I found a jewel in the crown of online offerings. And yes, I solved the fizz buzz problem too.
