<h1><strong>On my way to...</strong></h1><br>
<p>This is a personal blog to document my journey towards becoming a software developer and finding work that I will be proud to tell everyone about. If you like to follow along, I'd be excited to share with you what I learn</p><hr>
<h3>Beginning</h3>
<p><span class="text-muted">
	I have always been into STEM education, majoring in automotive engineering, fixing computers on the side and having software developers among friends. I have not had a chance to seriously dive into coding, not until moocs and other online learning tools took the stage and made it all possible for me. I had a gainful employment and a family with two sweet baby girls at that time. So the only thing I was missing was a passion to do something I always wanted - to solve problems on a computer. Being a lifelong learner with a 24/7 self paced online access to programmimg courses meant I could do it in my spare time. So I jumped right into it.
